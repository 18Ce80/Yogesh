			<p align="center">Hello! My name is Yogesh Chawan, I'm 20 years old. I have  know several coding Front-End and Back-End using different languages, such as HTML/CSS, C#, C++ and Java. I gathered interest in programming when I began high school. During the three years I was a high school student, I've learned , C# and Java, documenting my weekly assignments each semester on Google Sites. I wasn't sure what I could do with a career with Computer Science at the time, but I knew I was excited to see something I created in real time. I was eager to learn new concepts and develop more dynamic projects with these new technologies.
			<br><br>I'm currently attending Fr Agnel Polytechnic College, obtaining an Diploma in Computer Engineering. Internship in Computer Hardware in Summer 2019.</p>
